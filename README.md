## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Did this with mobile-first in mind, and it was a lot easier to make it work on desktop than the other way around.

### Continued development

What I'm struggling with is probably the naming of css variables, and how abstract I should make classes.
